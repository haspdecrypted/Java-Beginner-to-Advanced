# Java-Beginner-to-Advanced

This repo is categorised in two parts:

- [Beginner](https://github.com/haspdecrypted/Java-Beginner-to-Advanced/tree/main/Beginner)
- [Advanced](https://github.com/haspdecrypted/Java-Beginner-to-Advanced/tree/main/Advanced)

Under Beginner we will cover the basic fundamentals of coding and programs related to it.

In Advanced we will cover the advanced topics related to a data structure and time / space complexities from brute force solution to most optimised solution of it.

Each section will have a seperate folder for my personal Notes for better understanding.

This repo might also have a dedicated [Leetcode](https://github.com/haspdecrypted/Java-Beginner-to-Advanced/tree/main/Leetcode) section where I'll be solving questions of the platform.
